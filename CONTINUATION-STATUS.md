## 🔧 TASK 3: QUIZ QUESTION EXPANSION

### Current Status:
- ✅ **White Belt Stripe 1:** 10 questions complete (ready for testing)
- ✅ **White Belt Stripes 2-4:** 9 questions each (very close)
- ⚠️ **Blue Belt Stripe 1:** Has quiz but wrong questions (White Belt questions, need Blue Belt content)
- ❓ **Other Stripes:** Need to check current state and expand systematically

### Issue Found:
- `blue-belt-stripe1-gamified.html` has White Belt quiz questions instead of Blue Belt conflict questions
- Need to replace with belt-specific content

### Next Steps:
1. Audit all stripe quiz sections
2. Expand each stripe from 4 questions → 10 questions
3. Ensure belt-specific content (not generic)
4. Use questions from `scripts/add-quizzes-to-html.py` as base

## 🚨 KEY ISSUES FOUND

   - Need to replace with Blue Belt specific content
   - Location: `blue-belt-stripe1-gamified.html`
