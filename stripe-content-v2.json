It doesn't mean you can be vulnerable.\n                    </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Vulnerability-based trust</strong> is different. According to Lencioni's research, it's the confidence that your teammates will not use your weaknesses against you. It's knowing you can say \"I don't know,\" \"I was wrong,\" or \"I need help\" without being punished, judged, or secretly tallied against.\n                    </p>\n<p>\n                        Amy Edmondson's research at Harvard defines this as <strong>psychological safety</strong>: \"a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.\"\n                    </p>",

Some people are great training partners during drills, but become reckless or overly aggressive when rolling.\n                    </p>\n<p>\n                        The same happens in teams. Low-pressure vulnerability is easy. High-pressure vulnerability (admitting you don't have the answer when everyone's watching) is where trust is truly tested.\n                    </p>\n</div>",
