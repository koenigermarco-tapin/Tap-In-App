## 🎯 Core Philosophy

Built on two Delphic maxims:

1. **"Know Thyself"** (γνῶθι σεαυτόν) - Self-assessment and awareness
2. **"Nothing in Excess"** (μηδὲν ἄγαν) - Sustainable learning and burnout prevention

Combined with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu's belt progression system and modern psychological research from Google's Project Aristotle and Patrick Lencioni's 5 Dysfunctions framework.
