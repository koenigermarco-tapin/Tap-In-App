<h3>📖 Core Concept: Predictability-Based Trust</h3>
<p>
Most people confuse reliability with trust. They think: "I trust Sarah because she always delivers on time." That's <strong>predictability-based trust</strong>—useful, but limited. It means you can predict behavior. It doesn't mean you can be vulnerable.

<h3>📖 Core Concept: Vulnerability-Based Trust</h3>
<p>
<strong>Vulnerability-based trust</strong> is different. According to Lencioni's research, it's the confidence that your teammates will not use your weaknesses against you. It's knowing you can say "I don't know," "I was wrong," or "I need help" without being punished, judged, or secretly tallied against.
</p>
<p>
Amy Edmondson's research at Harvard defines this as <strong>psychological safety</strong>: "a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking."

<h4>📊 Research Evidence: Google's Project Aristotle</h4>

Google's 2-year study of 180 teams found that psychological safety—the belief that you won't be punished when you make a mistake—is the #1 predictor of team performance.

<h3>🔍 Why This Matters</h3>
<p>
Teams without vulnerability-based trust operate in constant self-protection mode. People hedge their language, hide their mistakes, and avoid asking for help. Energy that should go toward results gets wasted on political maneuvering and impression management.
</p>
<h3>💡 Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Predictability-based trust</strong> lets you rely on someone's behavior; <strong>vulnerability-based trust</strong> lets you be honest with them</li>
<li>Teams without vulnerability-based trust waste enormous energy on self-protection</li>
<li>Building vulnerability-based trust requires someone to go first—usually the leader</li>
</ul>

<h3>🧠 The Competence Trap</h3>

Most professionals have been trained by experience to protect themselves. They've learned that showing weakness is career suicide. Even if their current organization claims to value transparency, their nervous system remembers every time honesty backfired.
</p>
<p>
<strong>High achievers</strong> often build their identity around being the person with answers. Admitting "I don't know" feels like an identity threat. It's easier to fake confidence than to risk being seen as incompetent.

<p><strong>Without trust → No real conflict.</strong> People won't disagree honestly if they fear vulnerability will be weaponized. You get artificial harmony—everyone nodding in meetings, then complaining in private.</p>
<p><strong>Without conflict → No real commitment.</strong> If concerns aren't voiced, decisions feel imposed rather than chosen. People comply instead of commit.</p>
<p><strong>Without commitment → No real accountability.</strong> Why would anyone hold a colleague accountable to a decision they never truly supported?</p>
