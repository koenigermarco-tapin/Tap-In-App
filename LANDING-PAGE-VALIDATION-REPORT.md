- Both languages link to `deep-dive-assessment.html` / `deep-dive-assessment-de.html`
- This is the 46-question comprehensive assessment
- Time estimate: 3 minutes (may need adjustment if this is the longer assessment)

**Note:** If the starting assessment should be the shorter `leadership-style-carousel.html` (14 questions, ~3 minutes), links may need to be updated. Currently both pages link to the deep-dive assessment.

## 📝 NOTES

1. **Assessment Time:** Both pages now consistently show "3 minutes" for the assessment. If the `deep-dive-assessment.html` actually takes longer (it has 46 questions), this may need adjustment.

2. **Starting Assessment:** Currently both pages link to `deep-dive-assessment.html`. If the intended starting assessment is `leadership-style-carousel.html` (14 questions, ~3 minutes), links should be updated.

3. **No Hybrid Design:** As requested, the hybrid light→dark design has NOT been implemented. Both pages use the current dark theme design.
