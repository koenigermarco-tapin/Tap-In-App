This explains:
- Why I stopped here (strategic decision point)
- What's working vs. what's left
- Your options for how to proceed
- My recommendation (test first, then scale)

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO NOW

### Option 1: Test & Give Feedback (Recommended)
Test White Belt, tell me what to fix/change, then I'll scale to other belts

### Option 2: Continue Everything
Say "continue autonomous mode" and I'll finish all 80 lessons + email system

### Option 3: Prioritize Email System
Skip remaining content, build email platform first

## 💬 JUST TELL ME

- "It's perfect, continue with Blue Belt"
- "Fix X first, then continue"
- "Let's pivot to email system"
- "Change approach to Y"

I'm ready to execute whatever you decide.
