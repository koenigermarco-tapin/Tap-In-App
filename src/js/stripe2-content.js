<h3>🎯 Core Concept</h3>
<p>In BJJ, there's a concept called "giving your back." It's one of the worst positions—your opponent can choke you. No one voluntarily gives their back in competition.</p>
<p>Except in training with trusted partners. This is the <strong>vulnerability first move</strong>. Someone has to go first, and in teams, it must be the leader.</p>
</div>
<div class="research-box">
<h4>📊 Paul J. Zak's Research</h4>
<p>Leaders asking for help increases trust and cooperation. "Showing vulnerability" stimulates oxytocin production and generates trust.</p>

<h3>🎯 Strategic Vulnerability Examples</h3>
<ul>
